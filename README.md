miniframes - A collection of minimal frameworks

Introduction
Software development changes from developing utilities that solves isolated tasks to development of large systems that need to face challenges like a long life time, an ongoing development and an overall maintenance. The notation "large systems" is meant for those that connect multiple departments and external systems with each other or those that reflect a variety of business processes. Teams developing systems like this need to do refactorings and redesigns to face the mentioned challenges overall systems lifetime. For that the systems' sub-systems need to be "stable" enough to not "break" on those changes.

Frameworks used primarily for large systems are characterized by a complex design and restrictive guidelines by declaration or recommendation. In consequence those frameworks causing massive side effects to your design freedoms and architecture variations.

The miniframes frameworks try a different approach. The aim of those is a minimal influence of your design and (system) architecture. The inspiration for these solutions is based on a fifteen years experience in project teams developing large systems as described above.

Who am I?
My name is Matthias C. M. Zeimer. I am a software architect. I created the project miniframes on the 13th of May 2012 on the google code platform at https://code.google.com/archive/p/miniframes/. Now, of course some years later, Iâ€™ll start over again with the project on GitHub. The official homepage is http://miniframes.de which still redirects to the old google code account - this will be changed soon.

This start over will take some preparation time - please be lenient.
